# A Survey on Foundation Model-Driven Video Anomaly Understanding

## 🏠 About
This is the **systematic survey** of the **Foundation Model-driven Video Anomaly Understanding (VAU)** field. It includes two main parts: **Anomaly Perception** and **Anomaly Cognition** . The site provides a detailed taxonomy of existing methods, an overview of the unified perception-cognition framework, and the references cited in the paper. For each reference, we include its category, the link to the original paper, and code repository (if available).
